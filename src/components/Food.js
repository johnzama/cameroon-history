      <h2>Food of Cameroon</h2>
      <p>
        Cameroonian cuisine is as diverse as its people. Popular dishes include **Ndol√©**, a bitterleaf stew with peanuts, **Fufu** served with a variety of soups, **Achu** from the northwest, and **Koki**, a dish made of steamed black-eyed peas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each region of Cameroon has its own distinct culinary traditions, influenced by geography and the availability of ingredients. Street food, like **soya** (grilled meat), is also very popular.
