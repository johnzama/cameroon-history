      <h2>Culture of Cameroon</h2>
      <p>
        Cameroon is one of Africa's most culturally diverse countries, home to over 250 ethnic groups. The two official languages are French and English, but many indigenous languages are spoken across the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditional music and dance are integral to Cameroonian culture. The Makossa and Bikutsi music styles are world-famous, and dance forms vary from region to region. The arts of wood carving, pottery, and textiles also play a significant role in the country's cultural identity.
