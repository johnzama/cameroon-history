      <h2>History of Cameroon</h2>

      <h3>Pre-Colonial Era</h3>
      <p>
        Cameroon’s history stretches back thousands of years, with the region being home to diverse peoples and civilizations. Notable among them were the Sao civilization near Lake Chad and the powerful kingdoms of the Bamileke, Bamoun, and Bafut in the grasslands. These groups traded with nearby states and developed advanced political systems before the arrival of European explorers.

      <h3>The Arrival of Europeans</h3>
      <p>
        In the 15th century, the Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive on the coast of Cameroon. This era marked the beginning of European influence, including the establishment of the **transatlantic slave trade**. The coastal peoples, such as the Duala, played a significant role as intermediaries in the slave trade, linking inland societies to European traders.

      <h3>Colonial Cameroon and Slavery</h3>
      <p>
        By the late 19th century, Cameroon became a target of European colonization. The German Empire claimed the territory in 1884. Although slavery had existed long before colonization, the colonial period introduced new dynamics. Under German rule, slavery persisted, especially in the **Littoral (Duala region)** and **Adamawa**, despite attempts by German officials to diminish it through indirect measures.

      <p>
        In the **Duala region**, slavery was deeply intertwined with local trade and agricultural activities. The Germans, like local rulers, relied on the use of enslaved labor, especially in agriculture. In **Adamawa**, slavery was driven by the Fulbe-led state, where large-scale slave raiding was central to their economic structure. Despite the official colonial stance, slave trading continued, and Adamawa was even referred to as a "slave traders' Eldorado."

      <h3>Transition to French and British Rule</h3>
      <p>
        After Germany’s defeat in World War I, Cameroon was divided between **Britain** and **France**. French Cameroon saw efforts to promote rural capitalism, while slavery slowly diminished but continued in some regions, particularly in the north. British-controlled areas faced similar issues, with the British administration struggling to enforce anti-slavery measures, especially in the border areas near Nigeria. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The **League of Nations** mandate in the 1920s called for the abolition of slavery, yet the practice persisted into the mid-20th century, particularly in northern Cameroon. The economic and social structures built on slavery were difficult to dismantle, and colonial powers often prioritized economic stability over emancipation.
      </p>

      <h3>Independence and Modern Cameroon</h3>
      <p>
        Cameroon gained independence in 1960, with French Cameroon becoming the Republic of Cameroon and British Cameroon later joining to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. The country has since evolved into a key player in Central Africa, with rich cultural diversity and a complex political history. Despite economic and political challenges, Cameroon’s cultural heritage and historical significance remain strong pillars of its national identity.
