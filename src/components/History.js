      <h2>History of Cameroon</h2>
      <p>
        Cameroon has a rich and complex history that stretches back thousands of years. It has been home to a variety of civilizations, ranging from the Sao civilization near Lake Chad to powerful kingdoms such as the Bamoun and the Bafut in the grasslands.

      <p>
        The arrival of Europeans in the 15th century, especially the Portuguese, initiated significant changes, including trade in goods and slaves. During the colonial period, Cameroon was first claimed by Germany, later divided between Britain and France after World War I. Cameroon gained independence in the 1960s, leading to the formation of the modern nation.
